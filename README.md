# Installation
`Please clone the repository in order to run a local copy.`

# Usage
`The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their mobile budget application with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total should be updated when they're brought back online. I used IndexedDB to add offline functionality and service worker to the application.  I also added a Web Manifest to the application with the app’s metadata, to let users’ devices know what they’re installing and how the app should look on the home screen.`
